# Online multiple view tracking: Target association across cameras  

Developed by Quoc C.LE at LIFAT, University of Tours, France

### Introduction

**MDP_MTMC_tracking** is an online Multiple target Multiple Camera tracking method based on the code source of [1]

### Usage

1. Run complie.m (openCV required)
2. Run MTMC_test.m (the code is tested on the 2 sequences: PETS09 S2L1 and EPFL Terrace1)

### Dataset and Detection

Will be available soon.

### Evaluation metric

To validate the method, we adopt the popular metrics used in motchallenge.net including CLEAR MOT metric [2] and ID measures [3].
